    "description": "CONTEXT:  The client is a major trade association which sets industry safety and operational standards for their members and those members' suppliers.  It has a small ($120m revenue) TIC business as part of their overall business model.  It comprises of five different lines of business, including (1) Standards, (2) Certification services, (3) Individual certification programs; (4) Training; (5) Quality assurance for one of the industry's widely sold products.\n\nPROBLEM:  Currently the client charges their customer base in a very rudimentary basis.  For example, the price for technical standards is set based on the number of pages.  The client believes they can shift toward more \"value based pricing\" given how important their standards and certifications are totheir client base (eg. they form the basis for the clients' \"license to operate\" in the industry).  That said, the client is also aware that they cannot be \"too greedy\" because the overall trade association has a mission to promote safety and operational excellence in the members' industry, and thus disseminating these standards and certifications widely is part of the mission.  So, this tension between maximizing revenue from \"value based pricing\" and the non-profit mission of promoting safety should be respected and dealt with in a thoughtful manner. \n\nSCOPE:  Unclear right now, because we need this Pricing expert to help engage with the client and articulate what kind of scope this project would need to have in order to answer the client's question. \nEXPET QUALS:  Seeking a Pricing expert who is steeped in \"value based pricing\" approaches, ideally with experience in the TIC (testing, inspection, certification) space.  They would need to engage senior client executives credibly, with plenty of \"war stories\" and approaches that have worked well and produced tangible results with prior clients.  They would need to be able to scope the initial engagement, likely starting with one of the five lines of business as a proof of concept project, before moving on to the others.  They also need to be able to lead this work, supported by a team of consultants (likely generalist ex-MBB problem solvers).  If any particular analytical tools are required, they need to be able to help bring those into the project.",
